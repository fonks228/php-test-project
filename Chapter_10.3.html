            UPnP</pre></h2><br>
            The UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) protocol allows applications or host devices<br>
            to automatically find the front-end NAT device and send request to it to open the<br>
            corresponding ports. With UPnP enabled, the applications or host devices on the<br>
            ocal network and the internet can freely communicate with each other thus realizing<br>
the seamless connection of the network. You may need to enable the UPnP if you<br>
want to use applications for multiplayer gaming, peer-to-peer connections, real-time<br>
communication (such as VoIP or telephone conference) or remote assistance, etc.<br>
<ul>Tips:
    <li>UPnP is enabled by default in this router.<br></li>
    <li>Only the application supporting UPnP protocol can use this feature.<br></li>
    <li>UPnP feature needs the support of operating system (e.g. Windows Vista/ Windows 7/ Windows 8, etc. Some of<br>
        operating system need to install the UPnP components).<br></li>
</ul>
For example, when you connect your Xbox to the router which has connected to<br>
the internet to play online games, UPnP will send request to the router to open the<br>
corresponding ports allowing the following data penetrating the NAT to transmit.<br>
Therefore, you can play Xbox online games without a hitch.<br>
If necessary, you can follow the steps to change the status of UPnP.<br><!--зделать картинку тошо в пдф инструкции-->
