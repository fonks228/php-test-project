  <h1>NAT Forwarding</h1>
  <hr>
  <br>
  The routerâ€™s NAT (Network Address Translation) feature makes devices on the LAN use
  <br>
  the same public IP address to communicate with devices on the internet, which protects
  <br>
  the local network by hiding IP addresses of the devices. However, it also brings about
  <br>
  the problem that an external host cannot initiatively communicate with a specified
  <br>
  device on the local network.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the forwarding feature the router can penetrate the isolation of NAT and allows
  <br>
  devices on the internet to initiatively communicate with devices on the local network,
  <br>
  thus realizing some special functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The TP-Link router supports four forwarding rules. If two or more rules are set, the
  <br>
  priority of implementation from high to low is Port Forwarding, Port Triggering, UPNP
  <br>
  and DMZ.
  <br>
  <br>
  It contains the following sections:
  <br>
  <ul>
    <u>
    <li>Share Local Resources on the Internet by Port Forwarding</li>
    <br>
    <li>Open Ports Dynamically by Port Triggering</li>
    <br>
    <li>Make Xbox Online Games Run Smoothly by UPnP</li>
    <br>
    <li>Make Applications Free from Port Restriction by DMZ</li>
  </u>
</ul>
