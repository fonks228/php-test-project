    <ul>Tips:
        <li>The WAN IP should be a public IP address. For the WAN IP is assigned dynamically by the ISP, it is recommended to <br>
            apply and register a domain name for the WAN referring to <a href="">Make Applications Free from Port Restriction by DMZ.</a><br>
            Then users on the internet can use http:// domain name to visit the website.</li>
        <li>If you have changed the default External Port, you should use http:// WAN IP: External Port or http:// domain name: <br>
            External Port to visit the website.</li>
    </ul>

                Port Triggering can specify a triggering port and its corresponding external ports.<br>
                When a host on the local network initiates a connection to the triggering port, all the<br>
                external ports will be opened for subsequent connections. The router can record the <br>
                IP address of the host. When the data from the internet return to the external ports, the<br>
                router can forward them to the corresponding host. Port Triggering is mainly applied to<br>
                online games, VoIPs, video players and common applications including MSN Gaming<br>
                Zone, Dialpad and Quick Time 4 players, etc.<br>
                <br>
                Follow the steps below to configure the Port Triggering rules:<br>
                <br>

                        the router.<br>
