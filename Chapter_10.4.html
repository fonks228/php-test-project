            by DMZ</h2><br>
        When a PC is set to be a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) host on the local network, it is totally<br>
exposed to the internet, which can realize the unlimited bidirectional communication<br>
between internal hosts and external hosts. The DMZ host becomes a virtual server with<br>
all ports opened. When you are not clear about which ports to open in some special<br>
applications, such as IP camera and database software, you can set the PC to be a DMZ<br>
host.<br>
<small>Note:<br>
    When DMZ is enabled, the DMZ host is totally exposed to the internet, which may bring some potential safety hazards. If<br>
    DMZ is not in use, please disable it in time.</small><br>
    <b>I want to:</b><br>
    Make the home PC join the internet online game without port restriction.
    <br>
For example, due to some port restriction, when playing the online games, you can log<br> <!--зделать  For example, галубим-->
in normally but cannot join a team with other players. To solve this problem, set your PC<br>
as a DMZ host with all ports open.<br>
<br>
<b>How can I do that?</b>
<ol>
    <li>Assign a static IP address to your PC, for example 192.168.0.100.<br></li>
    <li>Visit <a href="http://tplinkwifi.net">http://tplinkwifi.net</a>, and log in with your TP-Link ID or the password you set for<>
        the router.<br></li>
        <li>Go to Advanced > NAT Forwarding > DMZ and tick to enable DMZ.</li>
        <li>Click VIEW CONNECTED DEVICES and select your PC. The Device IP<br>
            Address will be automatically filled in. Or enter the PC’s IP address 192.168.0.100<br>
            manually in the DMZ Host IP Address field.<br></li><!--зделать картинку с низу из пдф инстрикции-->
            <li>Click SAVE.</li>
            <b>Done!</b> <br>
            <br>
            The configuration is completed. You’ve set your PC to a DMZ host and now you can <br>
make a team to game with other players. <br>
