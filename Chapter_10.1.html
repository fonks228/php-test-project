        <h2><pre style="color: rgb(1, 136, 226);">10. 1.	 Share Local Resources on the Internet by Port <br>
         Forwarding</pre></h2><br>
         When you build up a server on the local network and want to share it on the internet, <br>
         Port Forwarding can realize the service and provide it to internet users. At the same <br>
         time Port Forwarding can keep the local network safe as other services are still invisible <br>
         from the internet. <br>
         <br>
        Port Forwarding can be used for setting up public services on your local network, <br>
        such as HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3/SMTP and Telnet. Different services use different <br>
        service ports. Port 80 is used in HTTP service, port 21 in FTP service, port 25 in SMTP <br>
        service and port 110 in POP3 service. Please verify the service port number before the <br>
        configuration. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>I want to:</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Share my personal website I’ve built in local network with my friends through the internet. <br>
        For example, the personal website has been built on my home PC (192.168.0.100). I hope <!--не забуца зделать " For example,"галубим-->
        that my friends on the internet can visit my website in some way. The PC is connected <br>
        to the router with the WAN IP address 218.18.232.154. <br> <!--зделать после етой страки картинку-->
        <br>
        <strong>How can I do that?</strong> <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Assign a static IP address to your PC, for example 192.168.0.100.</li>
            <li>Visit http://tplinkwifi.net, and log in with your TP-Link ID or the password you set for
                the router</li>
            <li>Go to Advanced > NAT Forwarding > Port Forwarding.</li>
            <li>Click</li> <!--зделать после клика картинку тошо в пдф инструкции-->
