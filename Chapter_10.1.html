        <h2><pre style="color: rgb(1, 136, 226);">10. 1.	 Share Local Resources on the Internet by Port <br>
         Forwarding</pre></h2><br>
         When you build up a server on the local network and want to share it on the internet, <br>
         Port Forwarding can realize the service and provide it to internet users. At the same <br>
         time Port Forwarding can keep the local network safe as other services are still invisible <br>
         from the internet. <br>
         <br>
        Port Forwarding can be used for setting up public services on your local network, <br>
        such as HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3/SMTP and Telnet. Different services use different <br>
        service ports. Port 80 is used in HTTP service, port 21 in FTP service, port 25 in SMTP <br>
        service and port 110 in POP3 service. Please verify the service port number before the <br>
        configuration. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>I want to:</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Share my personal website I’ve built in local network with my friends through the internet. <br>
        For example, the personal website has been built on my home PC (192.168.0.100). I hope <!--не забуца зделать " For example,"галубим-->
        that my friends on the internet can visit my website in some way. The PC is connected <br>
        to the router with the WAN IP address 218.18.232.154. <br> <!--зделать после етой страки картинку-->
        <br>
        <strong>How can I do that?</strong> <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Assign a static IP address to your PC, for example 192.168.0.100.</li>
            <li>Visit http://tplinkwifi.net, and log in with your TP-Link ID or the password you set for
                the router</li>
            <li>Go to Advanced > NAT Forwarding > Port Forwarding.</li>
            <li>Click</li> <!--зделать после клика картинку тошо в пдф инструкции-->
            <li>Click VIEW COMMON SERVICES and select HTTP. The External Port, Internal Port<br>
                and Protocol will be automatically filled in.<br></li>
                <li>Click VIEW CONNECTED DEVICES and select your home PC. The Device IP
                    Address will be automatically filled in. Or enter the PC’s IP address manually in the
                    Device IP Address field.</li>
                    <li>Click SAVE.</li><!--зделать картинку после Click SAVE-->
                    <small>Tips:
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is recommended to keep the default settings of Internal Port and Protocol if you are not clear about which port and<br>
                                protocol to use.<br></li>
                                <li>If the service you want to use is not in the common services list, you can enter the corresponding parameters<br>
                                    manually. You should verify the port number that the service needs.<br></li>
                                    <li>You can add multiple port forwarding rules if you want to provide several services in a router. Please note that the<br>
                                        External Port should not be overlapped.<br></li>
                        </ul>
                    </small>
        </ol>
<b>Done!</b><br>
<br>
Users on the internet can enter http:// WAN IP (in this example: http:// 218.18.232.154)<br>
to visit your personal website.
